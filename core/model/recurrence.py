    .. rubric:: Schedule exceptions

    One of the great features of moneyGuru is its ability to easy allow exceptions in its schedule.
    The amount changes one month? No problem, just change it. The transaction happens a day later?
    No problem, change it. From now on, every following transaction is going to happen a day later?
    No problem, hold shift when you commit the change to make it "global".

    All these exceptions, they have to be recorded somewhere. The "one-time" exceptions are kept in
    :attr:`date2exception`. The date used in the mapping is :attr:`Spawn.recurrent_date` because
    when we change the date of an exception, we still want to remember which recurrent date it
    replaces, so we used the date at which the *regular* transaction was supposed to happen.

    There are also the "global" exceptions, which are stored in :attr:`date2globalchange` and work
    kinda like normal exception, except that from the date they first happen, all following spawns
    are going to use this exception as a transaction model. This includes date. That is, if a global
    exception is 3 days later than its :attr:`Spawn.recurrent_date`, then all following spawns are
    going to to be 3 days later.

    Exceptions can override each other. We can be riding on a global exception and, suddenly, a
    newer global or local exception is there! Well, we apply that exception.

    An exception can also be a deletion, that is "oh, this week that transaction didn't happen".
    This is recorded by putting ``None`` in :attr:`date2exception`. When this deletion is done as
    a global change (from this date, this recurrence doesn't happen anymore), we simply set
    :attr:`stop_date`.

    """Regular budget for a specific account.

    A budgets yields spawns with amounts depending on how much money we've already spent in our
    account. For example, if I have a monthly budget of 100$ for "Clothing", then the budget spawn
    for a month that has 25$ worth of clothing in it is going to be 75$. This only works in the
    future.

    Budgets work very similarly to recurrences, except that a twist must be applied to them so they
    can work properly. The twist is about the spawn's "recurrence" date and the effective date. The
    recurrence date must be at the beginning of the period, but the effective date must be at the end
    of it. The reason for it is that since recurrence are only cooked until a certain date (usually
    the current date range's end), but that the budget is affects the date range *prior* to it, the
    last budget of the date range will never be represented.

    All initialization variables are directly assigned to their corresponding attributes.

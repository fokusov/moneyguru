class Chart(ViewChild):
    """Base abstract class for all charts.

    Charts are widgets that are "manually" drawn using conventional vector graphic drawing methods.
    Because we're in a cross toolkit environment, we can't use any specific API, so we made our own
    (and simplified) API to talk to the UI layer.

    The coordinates used in this API are related to the view size, which is given to us by the UI
    layer. Those coordinates are also bottom-left based, that is, the origin ``(0, 0)`` is at the
    top-bottom corner. For example, if the UI tells us that our view is 100x100, then the
    coordinates for a rectangle that takes a quarter of our view and is at the bottom left would be
    ``(0, 0, 25, 25)``.

    *Colors and fonts.* The details of how colors, pen size, brush size and fonts are handled is the
    responsibility of UI layers. In the core layers, we only deal in IDs. Every aspect of the graph
    has its ID, which is a simple numerical ID. For example, we have a ID for main axis lines. Do
    we want to axis lines to be black and with a 2pt width? Maybe, but that's for the UI layer to
    decide. When we draw our axis, we're telling the UI layer "draw me a line at those coordinates
    using the pen for main axis lines".

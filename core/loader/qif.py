# LITTLE NOTE ON QIF AND SPLITS
# The splits in QIF work in an awkward way which needs to be described here.
# First of all, the Total amount for the context account is always defined in the T field. This is
# the amount that has to go in that split. Then come the splits. However, the splits amounts are
# ***REVERSED***. Yes, ***REVERSED***. If, for example, I have a split between A B and C. A is
# debited for 3, B is credited for 4 and C is debited for 1. The end result will be:
# T3
# SB
# $4
# SC
# $-1

# ABOUT AutoSwitch
# This option is some kind of way to make a QIF file have extra info about accounts for which there
# are no txns. We ignore those. However, some QIF exporter have the good idea to not correctly clear
# the option flag, so this is a mess. What we do here is that we ignore the flag and always keep the
# last acount in a row of multiple account where there is not txns in between

# anything that is not part of an amount
